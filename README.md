## Whenever the user chooses, they can scrape the newest articles that have been added for any site correctly configured: As a rehearsal it is not intended to parse errors, so it is necessary to use correctly the tags for a new site to retrieve the new articles...

  If the user wishes to access the body of the note, they can click on the note and the form will be populated with the note body and title:
  The user can also delete notes that are no longer needed by clicking on the 'X':
  If the article is no longer of use, the user may delete it:
